### Goal
The goal was to build a dynamic webapp that used data comes from an API.

#### The Idea
After brainstorm, in full COVID19 context, we chose to orient our webapp to the cooking.
If you like to cook your own food...but never know what to do...
To do this, we chose **Edaman API https://www.edamam.com//**. We named our project: **get-my-recipe**

#### The Development
After setting our organisation and exploring the Api, we built wireframes and components tree. Then, we were able to start coding.
Everything in this project was made remotely.

During all the project, we managed the difficulties together and have experimented, in turn, the various functions of an agile method.

#### Tech
React-App, JS, React Bootstrap, css
